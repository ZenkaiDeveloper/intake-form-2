# Intake-Form

DESIGN STATEMENT

When visiting the doctor, there are many forms necessary to be completed. However, much of the information is redundant or not readily available to the patient. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice, if all medical intake information was readily available at the click of a button?

The Intake form app, was developed to provide a central source of truth for patient intake medical data. Patients will be able to update, create and share medical information with their medical care team in real time, with their most recent medical information.

SOLUTION

1. Profile interface with individual components that represent medical data
2. Generate PDF or Email
3. User Dashboard interface (provide user with their real time medical data )

INSTRUCTIONS
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install && npm start`
